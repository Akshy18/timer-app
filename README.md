## ✨ Features

- 🕒 **Create Timers**: Add timers with names, durations (up to 24 hours), and categories.
- 📁 **Category Management**: Group timers in collapsible categories, with defaults ("Workout", "Study", "Break") and custom options.
- ⚡ **Bulk Actions**: Start, pause, or reset all timers in a category via a dropdown menu.
- 📊 **Progress Visualization**: Display progress bars and a "Focus Mode" for distraction-free timer viewing.
- 🕰️ **Completion History**: Log completed timers with timestamps and deletion options.
- 🗑️ **Delete Options**: Remove individual timers or entire categories.
- 💾 **Data Persistence**: Store timers, categories, and history in localStorage.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher) or Yarn

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- Persistence: Uses localStorage to save timers, categories, and history (5MB limit).
- State Management: Employs useState for lightweight state handling.
- Styling: Leverages Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI design.
- Timer Logic: Implements countdowns with JavaScript’s setInterval.

### 📝 Development Assumptions

**The following assumptions were made to guide implementation and address assignment requirements**:

- **Persistence with localStorage**: Used localStorage for data storage, as it suits web apps and minimizes dependencies (5MB limit sufficient).
- **State Management with useState**: Opted for useState over Redux to keep the app lightweight, accepting minor prop drilling trade-offs.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Chose Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling, reducing custom CSS needs.
- **Timer Duration Constraints**: Limited timers to 24 hours and formatted durations >60 seconds as HH:MM:SS for practicality and readability.
- **Category Management Enhancements**: Included default categories ("Workout", "Study", "Break") and custom category creation for flexibility.
- **Bulk Actions UI**: Implemented bulk actions via a dropdown menu to streamline the UI and reduce clutter.
- **Focus Mode Addition**: Added a "Focus Mode" to highlight a single timer, enhancing usability for crowded lists.
- **History Log Enhancements**: Enabled manual deletion of history logs and included timestamps for better tracking.
- **Custom Alerts Behavior**: Auto-dismissed 50% completion alerts upon timer completion to avoid redundant notifications.
- **Single-Page Navigation**: Used a single-page layout instead of separate pages, aligning with web app UX patterns.
- **Omitted Bonus Features**: Skipped bonus features (e.g., data export, themes, filtering) to focus on core functionality within the 5-6 hour timeframe.
